# Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing
This repository contains all my solutions and annotations for [IBM's](https://www.ibm.com/) 
[Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-computer-vision-watson-opencv) course, including the capstone project.  

The course focuses on:  
- **Processing Images**  
- **Image Classification**  
- **Neural Networks**  
- **Object Detection**

All implementations use Python and machine learning libraries.

## Requeriments 
- To run the nootebooks you will need a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.anaconda.com/)

## File Structure
- `capstone`: Capstone Project  
- `classification-images`: Classification Images Lectures and Projects  
- `neural-network`: Neural Networks Lectures and Projects  
- `object-detection`: Object Detection Lectures and Projects  
- `processing-images`: Processing Images Lectures and Projects  

## Instalation
Clone the repository in our PC.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lemosslucas/ComputerVision.git
